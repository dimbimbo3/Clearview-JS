# Clearview-JS
My Final Project 1 for Web Services at MSU

This website acts as an online e-store that allows customers to make purchases and also provides relevant information stored in its database to employees, 
as well as functioning easily on mobile devices thanks to bootstrap (all without the use of any PHP). 
I worked off of the final project I had created by myself for Internet Computing, with permission, 
and switched everything to instead utilize JavaScript through NodeJS while also incorporating many changes to the UI and adding password encryption.

NodeJS packages I used: express; body-parser; mysql; bcryptjs; express-session; ejs; passport; passport-local; and connectflash.
